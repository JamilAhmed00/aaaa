## Problem Statement

Design, implement, and automate a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a web application. The pipeline should use **Docker** for containerization, **Kubernetes** for orchestration, and **Jenkins** as the CI/CD tool. The web application code is hosted on **GitHub**.

### Key Features
1. **Containerization**:
   - Create a Dockerfile to containerize the web application.
   - Build and push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Use Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment pipeline.
   - Configure Jenkins to trigger builds automatically when code is pushed to the GitHub repository.

3. **Kubernetes Deployment**:
   - Write Kubernetes manifests for deploying the web application (e.g., Deployment, Service, ConfigMap).
   - Deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster.

4. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
   - Use tools like Terraform or Ansible to provision the Kubernetes cluster and other necessary infrastructure.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Integrate basic monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) and logging (e.g., ELK stack) to track application performance and logs.

### Constraints
- The solution must be platform-agnostic (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure).
- The pipeline should handle rollback in case of deployment failure.
- The application should be accessible via a public IP or domain name.
- Use **best practices** for security (e.g., securing secrets, enabling HTTPS).

### Requirements
- Containerize the application using Docker and create a Dockerfile.
- Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
- Create a Jenkinsfile to automate the CI/CD pipeline.
- Trigger Jenkins builds automatically on GitHub code changes using webhooks.
- Write Kubernetes manifests for deploying the application (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap).
- Deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster.
- Provision infrastructure using Terraform or Ansible.
- Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
- Implement centralized logging using tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- Secure sensitive information (e.g., passwords, keys) using Kubernetes Secrets.
- Ensure the system is scalable to handle increasing user traffic.

### Steps to Complete
1. **Clone the Application Code**: Clone the web application code from a GitHub repository.
2. **Create Dockerfile**: Write a Dockerfile to containerize the application and build the Docker image.
3. **Push Docker Image**: Push the built image to a container registry like Docker Hub or a private registry.
4. **Setup Jenkins**: Install and configure Jenkins on a server. Use a Jenkinsfile to define the pipeline steps.
5. **Configure GitHub Webhook**: Configure GitHub to trigger Jenkins builds automatically when new commits are pushed to the repository.
6. **Write Kubernetes Manifests**: Write YAML manifests for the Kubernetes deployment, including Deployment, Service, and ConfigMap files.
7. **Provision Infrastructure**: Use Terraform or Ansible to provision the Kubernetes cluster and other necessary resources.
8. **Deploy to Kubernetes**: Apply the Kubernetes manifests to deploy the application to the cluster.
9. **Integrate Monitoring and Logging**: Set up monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) and centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack) for the application.
10. **Test and Validate**: Test the deployment by accessing the application via the public IP or domain name. Validate CI/CD pipeline functionality.
