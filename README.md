# Backend Developer Roadmap: Build a Scalable Task Management API

## Description

Your task is to create a backend API for a task management system that allows users to register, log in, and manage tasks. The system should include user authentication with role-based access control (RBAC), CRUD operations for tasks, middleware for input validation and logging, and proper error handling. Additionally, implement unit testing for major functionalities and deploy the application.

### Features to Implement:

1. **User Registration and Login**:
   - POST /register - Register a new user.
   - POST /login - Authenticate a user and return a JWT token.

2. **Task Management**:
   - GET /tasks - Get all tasks (admin only).
   - POST /tasks - Create a new task (authenticated users only).
   - GET /tasks/:id - Get a specific task by ID.
   - PUT /tasks/:id - Update a task (owner only).
   - DELETE /tasks/:id - Delete a task (owner only).

3. **Middleware**:
   - Input validation for all endpoints.
   - Logging of all requests.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle common HTTP status codes like 401, 403, 404, and 500.

5. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for user registration, login, and task CRUD operations.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application using a cloud service (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Azure).

### Constraints:
- Use Node.js with Express.js for the backend.
- Use PostgreSQL or MySQL for the database.
- Use JWT for authentication.
- Implement RBAC to distinguish between admin and regular users.
- Write clean, modular, and reusable code.
