# Backend API Development for a Blogging Platform

Your task is to develop a backend API for a blogging platform with the following features: user authentication and authorization, CRUD operations for blog posts and comments, and comprehensive error handling. The system must connect to a relational database (PostgreSQL or MySQL). Additionally, middleware for request validation and logging must be implemented. Ensure the API adheres to RESTful principles and includes unit tests for the critical functionalities.

## Endpoints to be Implemented:

```plaintext
1. POST /register - Register a new user.
2. POST /login - Authenticate a user and return a JWT token.
3. GET /posts - Fetch all blog posts.
4. POST /posts - Create a new blog post (Authenticated users only).
5. GET /posts/:id - Fetch a single blog post by ID.
6. PUT /posts/:id - Update a blog post (Owner only).
7. DELETE /posts/:id - Delete a blog post (Owner only).
8. POST /posts/:id/comments - Add a comment to a blog post (Authenticated users only).
9. GET /posts/:id/comments - Fetch all comments for a blog post.
```

## Constraints:

- Use Node.js with Express.js for the backend.
- Use PostgreSQL or MySQL for the database.
- Use JWT for authentication.
- Follow RESTful API design principles.
- Ensure proper validation for all inputs.
- Include unit tests for at least 5 major functionalities using a testing library (e.g., Jest, Mocha).

## Example Registration Request:

```json
POST /register
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}
```

## Example Blog Post Creation:

```json
POST /posts
Headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" }
Body:
{
  "title": "My First Blog Post",
  "content": "This is the content of my first blog post."
}
```

## Goal:

Build the backend system that meets all the requirements listed below and passes all test cases.
